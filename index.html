            <p> Wicket is a male Ewok scout, warrior and later Chief of Bright Tree Village.</p>

            <p>Though still young, he was brave to willingly join the Rebellion and aided in the battle against the Empire on his home planet. Don't let his innocent and cuddly look fool you, as he has been known to jab those who stand in his way with sticks</p>

            <p>Wicket also enjoys throwing rocks at storm-troopers, or anything that should resemble them, in his free time.</p>
